<p>So this morning I get to the office at a brisk 6:30. I sit down with my MSDN forum haze on and start sipping my plantation mint tea. I flip open my google reader and BOOM!!!! Right there on the Gu&rsquo;s blog is the announcement of the CTP5 of Entity Framework Code-First. My talk this Thursday is on POCO separation and Entity Framework. The light above me comes on, and Angels sing. This is the moment in which I realize that I have 4-5 hours of work until I can have something truly awesome, a great talk that is both on topic and timely with the latest technology!! It is times like these that I think Microsoft is conspiring to make my life Great! So off I go to rewrite my talk to use the latest CTP and the nifty new features. If you want to read the full write up here it is.</p>

<p>Gotta love it when the plan gets blown away and replaced by a better plan!!!</p>
