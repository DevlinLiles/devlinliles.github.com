<p>Describe Yourself:</p>
<p>Developer</p>
<p>I have been a professional developer for 4 years now mainly focused in the windows services and back ground communication pipelines. I was asked to pick up support for an app written with a lot of jQuery. I was given "jQuery Cookbook" by a friend and I fell in love. It is straight into the meat. Normally I have to wait 2-4 chapters before the useful stuff gets going and with the cookbook I was diving in right away. I haven't written any jQuery before reading the book but I did understand javascript and the DOM. With that foreknowledge the book made jQuery so amazingly easy. I could not have picked up jQuery in 2 short weeks without this book. I recommend this book to any professional developer that is looking to add jQuery to their skill set.</p>
