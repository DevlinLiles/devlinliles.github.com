title: Tyson Development Conference 09 - Setup

<pre class="csharpcode"><b></b></pre>

<p>This past week has been less focused on code for me and more focused on getting stuff setup for the TDC09. 
  <br />If you are not familiar with the TDC09 let me explain. Tyson Development Conference 2009 is a pet project of mine. I programmer for Tyson and had the idea with a couple friends at work that an internal version of TechEd would help Tyson IS overall. So I took it to the powers that be. They were all sorts of behind it, and now I am organizing it. It has turned into a lot of fun. I am getting to meet people I have never seen, and talk with groups like Microsoft and INETA for the speakers. So far it is 8 tracks, 6 sessions per track and filled with great stuff. 

  <br />That has been most of my free (not at work) time as of late. Hopefully next weeks blog will be more Code based as I am having tons of fun with Dynamic report engines. 

  <br />See you next week.</p>
