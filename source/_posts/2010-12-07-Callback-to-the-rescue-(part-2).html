title: Callback to the rescue (part 2)
date: 2010-12-07

<p>I came in this morning to the office and had a couple conversations about callback pattern and usage. It bothers me and several others to have if else if chains or switch statements in the usage. It should be far more intuitive. To help make that happen I went through and wrote a quick open source project that allows for a generic call to handle on the callback handler but it routes that to the right method. This should make using callback pattern far simpler and the code mush easier to understand. You simple implement the abstract class and write your handle methods. Those methods are then traversed and used to route callbacks to. Check it out.</p>
