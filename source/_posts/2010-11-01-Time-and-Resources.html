title: Time and Resources

<p>I have been spending my time and resources now working on getting to know Ruby and Java and trying to fully grasp OO principles. I want to make sure that no matter the language that I am using that I am writing the best code I can and that it adheres to the principles or Object oriented programming and design. To that end I started following a lot of new blogs, and this caused me to find more than one that has hit on the subject that I agree with more and more.</p>

<p>Developers should not specialize. Just like using FizzBuzz and other standard interview coding questions to understand the logical steps a person takes to write code. We should be pushing for a concept driven programmer instead of an implementation specialist. If you have a conceptually strong programmer you can throw almost any technology at them and they will succeed. If you have someone who doesn&rsquo;t understand the concepts and has focused on the specific implementation they know it will take much longer.</p>
