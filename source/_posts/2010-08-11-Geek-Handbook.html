<p><strong>I just got done reading &ldquo;Being Geek&rdquo;. It is awesome. I would recommend it to any geek that it is the business of IT.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> Being Geek by <em>O'Reilly Media</em></p>
<p>Awesome Handbook</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Easy to understand, Accurate, Enjoyable, Concise, Well-written</p>
<p>Best Uses:</p>
<p>Novice, Expert, Student, Intermediate</p>
<p>Describe Yourself:</p>
<p>Designer, Educator, Developer, Maker, Sys Admin</p>
<p>This is going to be a book that I have dog-eared, worn-covered, and close at hand. The interview personality section and the offer negotiation sections were incredibly helpful. The conversational style of the writing makes it a very easy read. I found that I was enjoying reading it and laughing and things like the bridge game. I got this book for writing another review and I have to say that it is an awesome find.</p>
