<p>My friend Jay Smith came up with the idea to post our stories on a blog post to allow the readers to find out more about us. His blog is at <a href="http://jaysmith.us">http://jaysmith.us</a> check it out. </p>  <p>I graduated high school in the spring of 2003 and took a summer job before starting college the next spring. I had been writing software since I was 8 and wanted to write it professionally after college, if of course I didn?t become an international soccer phenomenon I was working at a tire retreading shop when one day our boss decided to play a joke on his brother. His brother had let him borrow a 18 wheeler trailer, and he thought it would be funning to load it up with pallets before sending it back. We loaded these out of the field behind the shop. During loading this I got very sick and starting throwing up. I went home thinking it was just a stomach bug. When I got home I took a bath due to being very cold. I got out of the bath still shivering and unable to stop so my fianc? and brother decided to take me to the doctor. On the way to the doctor I went into seizures and they rushed me to the hospital. Once at the hospital I was admitted to the ER and they found 13 bite marks from my right shoulder to me left thigh. They tested 3 of the bite marks and found out that they bites were from a black widow. They didn?t order the antivenom for reasons I still don?t understand. The neurotoxin of the black widow normally goes into the body?s fat stores and is pushed out of the body in 2-3 weeks. I was 6?4? and 201 lbs after playing soccer competitively for 12 years and internationally for 3 years. I have very little body fat so the toxin went into the lining of my abdominal wall and continued to cause my abdominal muscles to seize for 9 months. During that time I was giving Methotrexate treatments and the doctors tried many things not having seen anything like this before. The treatments they said would prevent me from having children but my fianc? was pregnant by 2 weeks so we took that as a miracle.&#160; After 9 months of ER visits and horrible amounts of pain the doctor told me I would just have to deal with the pain and they were going to install a morphine pump in my back to manage the pain. They made an inventory mistake which caused them to have to order a pump for my body size (which after 9 months of all this was 6?4? and 135 lbs.) The doctor gave me duragesic patches until the pump came in. I ended up being allergic to the adhesive and threw up for 2-3 days. I got dehydrated enough that the rest of the venom was force out of my abdominal wall and I have been symptom free ever since. I was in a deep depression for a little over a year after this until my daughter was born. I think the term is rock bottom but that is what I hit. I got back on my feet and got a job working at the Tyson Foods factory that my dad managed safety at. I worked my butt off for 5 months and was promoted to management-support overseeing 5-7 guys in the receiving area. While in this position I wrote some work around software to fix some broken pieces of the MES system. This got the attention of the director of MES execution at corporate IS. He came to Sherman and we talked. He asked to have my resume and 4 months later with the help of a great recruiter I was on the MES team writing software. That is the short version of my story and how I came into the Software Development profession. </p>  <p>I am hoping several other friends of mine will post this kind of post to allow people to connect with the authors.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Watch this places:</p>  <p><a href="http://jaysmith.us/">http://jaysmith.us/</a></p>  <p><a href="http://robtennyson.us/">http://robtennyson.us/</a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Thanks for the time</p>
